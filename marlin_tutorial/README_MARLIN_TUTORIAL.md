## üß† **What is Marlin?**

Marlin is a **highly optimized GPU kernel** for 4-bit quantized General Matrix-Vector (GEMV) operations, specifically designed for **Large Language Model (LLM) inference**.

### **The LLM Inference Challenge:**
```
Input:     Activation Vector [M x 1] (FP16/FP32)
Weights:   Weight Matrix [N x M] (4-bit quantized)
Scales:    Per-group scaling factors [N/group_size x 1] (FP16/FP32) 
Output:    Result Vector [N x 1] (FP16/FP32)

Operation: Output = (Weights_dequantized * Scales) @ Input
```

### **Why 4-bit Quantization?**
- **Memory Reduction**: 4x less memory than FP16 (critical for large models)
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: 4x more weights fit in same memory transaction
- **Compute Efficiency**: Modern GPUs can handle mixed precision efficiently
- **Quality Preservation**: With proper quantization, minimal accuracy loss

### **Marlin's Key Innovations:**
1. **Optimal Memory Layout**: 4-bit weights stored for maximal coalescing
2. **Warp Specialization**: Producer warps (load) + Consumer warps (compute)
3. **Efficient Dequantization**: Minimal overhead 4-bit ‚Üí FP16 conversion
4. **Advanced Reduction**: Cross-warp communication for final output
5. **Memory-Compute Overlap**: Pipeline design hides memory latency
